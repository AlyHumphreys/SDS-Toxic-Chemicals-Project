# Project Title
"Let's Find Toxic Chemicals"
# Project Goals
Our goal in this project is to firstly index our data so that we can properly analyze and classify connections between toxicity levels and their binary molecular fingerprint. We are using data taken from machine learning methods to identify toxicity levels in special chemicals. Because this data set essentially only consists of two variables (molecular fingerprint and experimental class of toxicity), we are going to index our data and look for any correlations.
